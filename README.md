# Thumbnail Generator

This is the code that is used to generate the thumbnails that are seen on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TemplepatrickPCI).

By default, it'll generate a thumbnail for the nearest Sunday. For example: if today is Wednesday 2nd August 2023, it will generate a thumbnail for Sunday 6th August 2023. If today is Sunday 6th August 2023, it will generate a thumbnail for 13th August 2023.
